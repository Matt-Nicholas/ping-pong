# Ping Pong

#### A game that accepts a number and returns a list of number and words

#### By **Matthew F Nicholas**

## Description

A web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:
Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "ping-pong"

## BDD
  -Accepts input from the user
    -confirms that the input is a number
  -count from 1 thru the inputted number
  -checks for multiples of 15, then, 5, then 3
    -replaces the number with the appropriate word and adds them to a string
    -if not divisible the number is added to the string
  -prints the resulting string to a list
